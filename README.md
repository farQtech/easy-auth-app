### API (NestJS)
- Uses JWT authentication and bcrypt for password hashing
- Rate limiting and account lockout for brute-force protection
- Centralized error and log messages
- Helmet for secure HTTP headers
- Environment variables for secrets
- Linting and formatting enforced

### Client (React)
- All sensitive logic handled on the backend
- Form validation and password strength enforcement
- No secrets or tokens stored in code
- Linting and formatting enforced
